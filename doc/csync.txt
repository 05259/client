csync is a file synchronizer for Linux and allows to keep two copies of files
and directories in sync.  It uses uses widly adopted protocols like smb or sftp
so that there is no need for a server component of csync.

Introduction
------------

It is often the case that we have multiple copies (called replicas) of a
filesystem or part of a filesystem (for example on a notebook and on a desktop
computer). Changes to each replica are often made independently and as a result
they do not contain the same information. In that case a file synchronizer is
used to make them consistent again, without loosing any information.

The goal is to detect conflicting <<X13, updates>> (files which has been modified) and
propagate non-conflicting updates to each replica.
